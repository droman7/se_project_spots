# Project 3: Spots

An image sharing site

## Description
    Spot project allowed me to practice skills used from the pervious sprints to organize and structure a webpage in the form of a media sharing site.
    Practice with the Figma resource helped me see how to change the webpage to a set design that will prove useful in real world applications.
    Implemented grid to layout the site and used media queries for smaller displays layouts. Webpage is now responsive.

## Update
    Incorporated javascript into the webpage so now buttons and images are interactive and can hold and delete information.
